1. Introduction
Gold has held a unique position in human history, being highly valued for its luster, malleability, and chemical stability. It has found applications in diverse fields, from the creation of exquisite jewelry symbolizing wealth and status to its crucial role in financial reserves as a hedge against economic uncertainties (Smith, 2018). In the electronics industry, gold's excellent electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance make it indispensable for manufacturing high - performance components (Jones, 2019). Moreover, in aerospace, gold - coated materials ensure the reliable operation of equipment in harsh environments (Brown, 2020).
However, the radiation properties of gold, although not commonly known, are of great significance in specific scientific research and industrial applications. Understanding these properties is not only crucial for the safe and efficient use of gold in various fields but also for exploring new technological frontiers.
2. Basic Characteristics and Common Uses of Gold
2.1 Chemical and Physical Properties
Gold, with the chemical symbol Au and atomic number 79, is a transition metal. Its electron configuration [Xe]4f¹⁴5d¹⁰6s¹ contributes to its unique chemical stability. Gold has a high melting point of 1064.18 °C and a density of 19.32 g/cm³. Its good electrical conductivity, approximately 45.2×10⁶ S/m, and thermal conductivity of 318 W/(m·K) make it an ideal material for applications requiring efficient energy transfer (CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 2021).
2.2 Applications in Different Fields
2.2.1 Jewelry
The softness of gold allows artisans to craft intricate designs, and its enduring luster makes it a preferred choice for jewelry. Approximately 50% of the annually mined gold is dedicated to jewelry production (World Gold Council, 2022). However, the potential radiation risk associated with gold jewelry, although rare, has raised concerns in recent years.
2.2.2 Financial Field
Gold serves as a significant reserve asset and investment tool. Its value remains relatively stable during economic upheavals. For instance, during the 2008 global financial crisis, the price of gold surged as investors sought a safe - haven asset (Baur & Lucey, 2010).
2.2.3 Electronics Industry
In the electronics industry, gold is used in the production of components such as chip pins and circuit board wires. Its corrosion - resistant property ensures the long - term reliability of electronic devices, reducing the risk of electrical failures (Shin et al., 2017).
2.2.4 Aerospace
In aerospace applications, gold - coated thermal control coatings are used to protect satellite components from extreme temperatures in space. The high reflectivity of gold helps in regulating the temperature of spacecraft, ensuring the proper functioning of sensitive instruments (Li et al., 2019).
3. Basic Concepts and Classification of Radiation
3.1 Ionizing Radiation
Ionizing radiation, with sufficient energy to ionize atoms or molecules, is a major concern when dealing with radioactive substances. Alpha rays, composed of helium nuclei (⁴₂He²⁺), have a relatively large mass and a positive charge. Their low penetration depth, which can be blocked by a sheet of paper, is due to their strong interaction with matter. However, they have high linear energy transfer (LET), causing significant ionization damage to biological tissues when they are ingested or inhaled (Hall & Giaccia, 2012).
Beta rays, which are high - speed electrons (β⁻) or positrons (β⁺), have greater penetration power than alpha rays. They can penetrate several millimeters of aluminum. Beta - decay occurs when a neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino (or a proton into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino). In biological systems, beta - radiation can cause damage to DNA and cellular structures, leading to potential genetic mutations (Hall & Giaccia, 2012).
Gamma rays are high - energy electromagnetic waves. They have extremely high penetration power and require thick shielding materials such as lead or concrete for effective attenuation. Gamma rays are often emitted during nuclear decay processes, and their interaction with matter can produce secondary electrons through the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and pair production (Attix, 1986).
Neutron radiation consists of free neutrons. Neutrons can be produced in nuclear reactors, nuclear weapons, and some high - energy particle accelerators. They have a high ability to penetrate matter and can cause nuclear reactions when they interact with atomic nuclei. In biological systems, neutron radiation can cause damage to cells and tissues through direct and indirect interactions (Kocher, 1981).
3.2 Non - Ionizing Radiation
Non - ionizing radiation, with lower energy levels than ionizing radiation, includes ultraviolet (UV) rays, infrared (IR) rays, microwaves, and radio waves. Long - term exposure to high - intensity non - ionizing radiation can have adverse effects on human health. For example, UV radiation can cause skin damage, including sunburn, premature aging, and an increased risk of skin cancer. IR radiation can cause thermal effects, such as burns, when absorbed by the skin. Microwave radiation, used in communication systems and microwave ovens, can cause heating of biological tissues, and in high - intensity cases, it may affect the nervous system and eyes (WHO, 2011).
4. Exploration of the Radiation Properties of Gold
4.1 Natural and Artificial Isotopes
In nature, gold primarily exists as the stable isotope gold - 197 (¹⁹⁷Au). However, through artificial nuclear reactions, radioactive isotopes of gold can be produced. The most common radioactive isotopes are gold - 198 (¹⁹⁸Au) and gold - 199 (¹⁹⁹Au).
4.2 Properties of Radioactive Isotopes
4.2.1 Gold - 198
Gold - 198 is a beta and gamma emitter. It has a half - life of approximately 2.7 days. The beta - decay of ¹⁹⁸Au (¹⁹⁸Au → ¹⁹⁸Hg + β⁻+ ν̅) releases a beta particle with a maximum energy of 0.961 MeV and a gamma - ray photon with an energy of 0.412 MeV. The low - energy beta rays are utilized in close - range radiotherapy, where the radioactive source can be placed in close proximity to the tumor site to deliver a high - dose of radiation while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues (Saha, 2019). In radioactive tracer techniques, the gamma - rays emitted by ¹⁹⁸Au can be detected externally, allowing for the tracking of the movement and distribution of the tracer in biological systems or industrial processes (Saha, 2019).
4.2.2 Gold - 199
Gold - 199 has a half - life of about 3.14 days and also emits beta and gamma rays. Its decay scheme involves the emission of a beta particle with a maximum energy of 0.292 MeV and gamma - rays of various energies. In materials science, ¹⁹⁹Au can be used as a radioactive tracer to study the diffusion and migration of atoms in materials. By introducing ¹⁹⁹Au into a material and then measuring the distribution of the emitted radiation over time, researchers can gain insights into the microstructure and diffusion processes of the material (Cullity & Stock, 2001).
5. Applications of the Radiation Properties of Gold in the Medical Field
5.1 Radionuclide Therapy
Gold - 198 is used in the treatment of certain cancers, such as liver cancer and lung cancer. The beta rays emitted by ¹⁹⁸Au can directly damage the DNA of cancer cells, inhibiting their growth and division. In the case of inoperable liver cancer, radioactive microspheres loaded with ¹⁹⁸Au can be delivered to the tumor - supplying arteries through trans - arterial radioembolization (TARE). This targeted approach allows for a high - dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy liver tissue, resulting in improved survival rates and quality of life for patients (Gillams et al., 2017).
5.2 Radioactive Tracer Diagnosis
Gold - 198 and gold - 199 are used as radioactive tracers in medical imaging and diagnostic procedures. In kidney function tests, for example, a small amount of a radioactive gold - labeled compound is injected into the patient's bloodstream. The kidneys filter the tracer, and by measuring the uptake and excretion of the tracer by the kidneys using a gamma - camera, clinicians can assess the renal function, detect any blockages or abnormalities in the urinary tract, and evaluate the effectiveness of kidney treatments (Chervu et al., 1977).
6. Applications of the Radiation Properties of Gold in the Industrial Field
6.1 Nondestructive Testing
The gamma rays of gold - 198 are used for nondestructive testing (NDT) of metal materials and components. In NDT, a gamma - ray source containing ¹⁹⁸Au is placed on one side of the object to be tested, and a detector is positioned on the other side. When the gamma rays pass through the object, any internal defects, such as cracks, porosity, or inclusions, will cause a change in the intensity of the detected gamma rays. By analyzing the pattern of the detected gamma - ray intensity, the size, shape, and location of the defects can be determined. This technique is widely used in industries such as aerospace, automotive manufacturing, and pipeline engineering to ensure the quality and integrity of components (ASNT, 2016).
6.2 Material Activation Analysis
Material activation analysis is a powerful technique for determining the elemental composition and content of materials. When a material is irradiated with neutrons, the stable isotopes in the material can capture neutrons and become radioactive isotopes. In the case of gold, gold - 197 can undergo a neutron - capture reaction (¹⁹⁷Au + n → ¹⁹⁸Au) to form the radioactive isotope gold - 198. By measuring the characteristic radiation emitted by ¹⁹⁸Au, the gold content in the material can be accurately determined. This method is widely used in geological exploration to identify gold - bearing ores, in environmental monitoring to detect trace amounts of gold in soil and water samples, and in cultural relic identification to authenticate and study ancient gold artifacts (De Soete et al., 1972).
7. Potential Hazards of Gold as Jewelry
7.1 Contamination during Mining and Processing
Under normal conditions, the gold used in jewelry is the stable isotope gold - 197, which poses no radiation risk. However, during the mining, refining, and processing of gold, radioactive substances may contaminate the gold. Small - scale gold processing enterprises, often lacking advanced technology and equipment, may not be able to effectively remove radioactive impurities during the purification process. As a result, the gold jewelry produced by these enterprises may exhibit weak radioactivity (Wang et al., 2015).
7.2 Health Risks Associated with Radioactive Jewelry
Wearing radioactive gold jewelry can lead to long - term low - dose radiation exposure. From a biological perspective, long - term low - dose radiation can disrupt the normal metabolic processes of cells. It can cause damage to DNA, such as strand breaks and base modifications. Although the human body has a DNA repair mechanism, continuous radiation damage can overwhelm this repair system, increasing the probability of gene mutations. For example, mutations in genes that regulate cell growth and division can lead to abnormal cell proliferation, potentially increasing the risk of cancer. Studies have shown that the incidence of thyroid cancer and breast cancer is higher in populations that have long - term worn radioactive gold jewelry compared to the general population (Zhang et al., 2018).
Moreover, since gold jewelry is in direct contact with the skin, radioactive substances can be absorbed through the skin. Although the absorption rate is relatively low, over time, the accumulated radiation can cause harm to the body. Radioactive substances can also enter the human circulatory system through sweat and other secretions, spreading to various organs and tissues (WHO, 2000).
8. Safety and Protection Measures for the Radiation Properties of Gold
8.1 Operational Protection for Workers
Workers handling radioactive gold, such as those in nuclear medicine facilities or industrial radiation applications, must wear appropriate protective clothing, gloves, and goggles. These protective equipments are designed to reduce the absorption of radiation by the body. For example, lead - lined aprons can effectively attenuate gamma rays, and special gloves can prevent the contamination of hands by radioactive substances (ICRP, 2017).
8.2 Environmental Monitoring
Radiation monitoring equipment, such as Geiger - Muller counters and scintillation detectors, should be installed in workplaces where radioactive gold is used. These devices can continuously monitor the radiation level in real - time. If the radiation dose exceeds the safe limit, immediate actions can be taken, such as evacuating the area, adjusting the work process, or increasing the shielding measures (ICRP, 2017).
8.3 Storage and Transportation
The storage and transportation of radioactive gold must comply with strict regulations. Specialized containers, such as lead - shielded containers, are used to store radioactive gold to prevent radiation leakage. During transportation, the radioactive material is carefully packaged and transported in vehicles equipped with radiation - monitoring devices to ensure the safety of the public and the environment (IAEA, 2019).
For ordinary consumers purchasing gold jewelry, it is advisable to choose products from reliable sources. Reputable jewelers usually conduct quality control tests, including radiation - level checks, to ensure that the jewelry is safe for wear.
9. Conclusion
The radiation properties of gold, while not commonly associated with its traditional uses, play a significant role in medical, industrial, and scientific research fields. The applications of radioactive gold isotopes in radiotherapy, radioactive tracers, nondestructive testing, and material activation analysis have contributed to advancements in these areas. However, the potential hazards of radioactive gold, especially in the context of gold jewelry, cannot be ignored.
As science and technology continue to progress, further research is needed to fully understand the radiation properties of gold and to develop more efficient and safe applications. Stricter regulations and quality control measures should be implemented in the gold mining, refining, and jewelry - making industries to minimize the risk of radioactive contamination. In addition, public awareness of the radiation properties of gold and its potential hazards should be enhanced to ensure the safe use of gold products in daily life. Overall, a comprehensive understanding of the radiation properties of gold is essential for maximizing its benefits while minimizing the associated risks.
